Step 22 You will now see a box like in this image and you will type your validated domain name, if you want to host from a subdomain that is fine too:

Step 23 We will generate our own CSR for this step, open bash, cmd, or git shell on your desktop and enter `openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout yourname.key -out yourname.csr` just like that for simplicity:

Step 24 It will ask you questions (first being a pass phrase and to confirm that phrase), fill everything out to the best of your ability, if you dont know the answer to something use `.`:

Step 25 When the script is done it will dump the files (yourname.key and yourname.csr) on your desktop:

Step 26 Open yourname.csr with a text editor, I use sublime:

Step 27 Copy and paste it all into www.startssl.com in the box asking you for the CSR and press submit:

Step 28 It will show you a screen like this, if it says "Click here" then click on the "here" and it will download the certificates in a zipped folder:

Step 29 Wild certificate zip has appeared:

Step 30 Unzip that folder and open it up then unzip the other server folder and open that up it will have the intermediate, root and the certificate within it:

Step 31 We will now combine these certs into one file in a certain way 1. Open your_domain_name.crt in a text editor and copy it to a new file, 2. Open the intermediate certificate in a text editor copy it and paste it in the file directly below your_domain_name.crt 3. Repeat the same exact thing with the root certificate and save this file as `cert.pem` it should look similar to the image below:

Step 32 Now the server needs yourname.key to be unencrypted to be able to function in SSL mode. So we will go back to shell on our desktop and type this `openssl rsa -in yourname.key -out private.key`:

Step 32 Enter the passphrase, if everything went well you will see this:

Step 33 We are pretty much done now you should have these two files on your desktop:

Step 34 Copy and paste these two files to your config folder open your config.ini in a text editor thats not notepad.exe and make the ssl lines look similar to mine (copy the path to each file into your config.ini):

Step 35 You should now be able to run the server in SSL mode if you followed this guide and if I didnt mess up somewhere along the way:
